Set up for mac OS


Install Dependencies:

Open Terminal on your MacBook Pro.
Install py2app using pip:
Copy code
pip install py2app
Create a Setup Script:

Create a file named setup.py in the root directory of your project.
Copy and paste the following code into setup.py:
python
Copy code
from setuptools import setup

APP = ['main.py']
OPTIONS = {
    'argv_emulation': True,
}

setup(
    app=APP,
    options={'py2app': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2app'],
)
Package Your Application:

In Terminal, navigate to the directory containing your main.py and setup.py files.
Run the following command to create the standalone macOS application:
arduino
Copy code
python setup.py py2app
Distribute Your Application:

Once the packaging process is complete, you'll find a dist directory in your project folder.
Inside the dist directory, you'll find your standalone macOS application (.app file).
Distribute the .app file to users, who can then double-click it to install and run your application.
These steps will allow you to create an installation wizard for your Python code, making it easy for users to install and run your application on their macOS devices.
