Install Dependencies:

Open Command Prompt on your Windows computer.
Install PyInstaller using pip:
Copy code
pip install pyinstaller
Create a Setup Script:

Create a file named setup.py in the root directory of your project.
Copy and paste the following code into setup.py:
python
Copy code
from setuptools import setup

APP = ['main.py']
OPTIONS = {
    'argv_emulation': True,
}

setup(
    app=APP,
    options={'py2exe': OPTIONS},
    setup_requires=['py2exe'],
)
Package Your Application:

In Command Prompt, navigate to the directory containing your main.py and setup.py files.
Run the following command to create the standalone Windows executable:
arduino
Copy code
python setup.py py2exe
Distribute Your Application:

Once the packaging process is complete, you'll find a dist directory in your project folder.
Inside the dist directory, you'll find your standalone Windows executable (.exe file).
Distribute the .exe file to users, who can then double-click it to install and run your application on their Windows computers.
These steps will allow you to create an installation wizard for your Python code on a Windows computer, making it easy for users to install and run your application.
